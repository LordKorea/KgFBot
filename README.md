# BaseBot

A basic framework for discord bots using python.

## Requirements

This bot requires `discord.py` ( https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py ) and
python 3.7 to run.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

2. Install `discord.py` (e.g. via `pip3`)

3. Put the bot token of your bot account into a file called `tokenfile` in the
same directory as `start.sh`.

4. Run `./start.sh`.

To stop the bot, send a keyboard interrupt (^C on linux). The bot will then shut
down. **This might take a bit!**
